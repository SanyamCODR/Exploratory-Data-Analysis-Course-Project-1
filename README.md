# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1

## Overview
This repository contains the R scripts and output PNG files for the first course project of the Exploratory Data Analysis course on Coursera. It focuses on the analysis of individual household electric power consumption.

## Files
- `plot1.R`: Script to generate the first plot (Histogram of Global Active Power).
- `plot2.R`: Script to generate the second plot (Global Active Power over Time).
- `plot3.R`: Script to generate the third plot (Energy Sub Metering).
- `plot4.R`: Script to generate the fourth plot (Multiple Time Series).
- `plot1.png`: Output file for the first plot.
- `plot2.png`: Output file for the second plot.
- `plot3.png`: Output file for the third plot.
- `plot4.png`: Output file for the fourth plot.

## Data
The data for this project was taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), specifically the [Individual household electric power consumption Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

## How to Run
To run these scripts, you will need R and the `data.table` package for handling data. Each script reads the data, processes it, and saves a plot in PNG format.
